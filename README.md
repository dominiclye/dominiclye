### Keep reading to learn about me ↓

My name is Dominic and I'm a 16 y/o developer currently situated in Melbourne, Australia.
As of late, I've been working to refine my python skills before I delve into other languages. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to reverse engineer API, as well as a smidgeon of HTML, CSS and JS
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will allow me to develop my python skills.
- 🍄 Fun Fact: I'm currently learning french so I can work there after I finish my studies in Australia.
